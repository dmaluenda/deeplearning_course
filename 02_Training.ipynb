    "Neural networks basically are nonlinear functions that connect $x$ inputs to $y$ outputs, through some $\\omega$ inner free parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exactly dependence of $y$ on $x$ and $\\omega$ is completely defined by the neural network architecture, i.e. number of layers, number of neurons in each layer and which activation function is applied in each layer. At the end of the day, it can be written as $y=g(x;\\omega)$, where $g(\\cdot)$ is a quite complex function made of a concatenation of known and smaller functions (matrix multiplication and activation functions in each layer step).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $x$ and $y$ might be vectors capable to hold several input and output values, whereas $\\omega$ here collects any free parameter on the neural network, that is all weights and biases in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The desired behavior of the network is to give an output $y$ for a given input $x$, this is called ***prediction*** or ***inference***. To do that, it has to adjust its $\\omega$ inner free parameters to accomplish this goal. This is done by providing examples of $(x,y)$ input-output pairs while the networks tries to minimize the error when predicting its own $y$ output. This minimizing process is call ***training***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a network training is an optimization problem to fit a nonlinear function, where the whole collection of $\\omega$ inner parameters are the trainable values and the $x$ inputs and $y$ outputs are multidimensional (vectors). Therefore, deep learning training mathematically is a nonlinear and multidimensional fitting."
